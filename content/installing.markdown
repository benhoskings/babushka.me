title: Installing babushka
---

You can install babushka on your system, no matter what state it's in, using `babushka.me/up`. That's a script that knows enough to install ruby if required (babushka's only runtime dependency), and then download a temporary babushka that knows how to do the proper install.

To use `babushka.me/up`, all you need is something like `curl` or `wget`, that can fetch over http. Mac OS X has `curl`:

    bash -c "`curl babushka.me/up`"

Ubuntu and some other Linux distros have `wget` instead:

    bash -c "`wget -O - babushka.me/up`"

It's a nice way to kick things off on a new server, or on your new laptop, since it can literally be the first command you run on the machine. In a few commands' time you can have your commandline all set up, or your favourite apps installed, or whatever other task you write a recipe for.

Even though babushka is a ruby application, there's no gem distribution. The reason for this is that setting up a particular ruby build, rubygems, and maybe rvm along the way is just the kind of thing babushka is good at. So in the interests of consistency, there's just one install method, which doesn't require anything other than something like `curl` or `wget`.

The bootstrapper is pretty simple. All it does is install ruby if required (using the system's package manager; OS X systems already have ruby installed), download a tarball of babushka, and run `babushka babushka`, which kicks off a built-in recipe that installs babushka for real. Meta, eh?

Babushka itself has just one extra requirement alongside `ruby` and `curl`/`wget`, which is `git`. The install process takes care of installing git on your system if you don't already have it. On Linux, babushka will use the system's package manager; on OS X, the binary package from git-scm.com (otherwise installing babushka would require Xcode).

If you'd prefer to install manually or just check out the code, check [http://github.com/benhoskings/babushka](the github page) for the repo URL.
